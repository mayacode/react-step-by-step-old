## Lesson 1
**Init the project, make first branch and commit in git repository**

1. create project directory
`mkdir react-step-by-step`

2. inside project directory type:
`npm init`

3. answer all questions, it is good fill as much data as possible.
Also create git repository, link it with your project.
Create your first branch and make an initial commit with
freshly created file `package.json`. Never ever make commits to
your main branch (`master`, `develop`, ...)

4. Create `README.md` and write at least basic information about
your project. You will add specific information later, when
project will grow. Keeping README up-to-date is very important,
especially if you work with a team. But also for one-man-project
it is great place to keep all important information in one
place.

5. Create `.gitignore` file and define there all files and directories
not related to project. For example `node_modules` created by
installing libraries in your project should be added here.
Also IDE files (like `.idea` if you use Webstorm) should be here.
